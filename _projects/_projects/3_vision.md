### Project Overview
Developed during research stays at **Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany)** and **UC Santa Cruz (USA)**, this work focuses on **Edge AI**—running complex models on portable devices to assist visually impaired users in real-time.

### Technical Innovations
* **Vending Machine Interaction:** We deployed **YOLO/SSD object detection models** to identify products and buttons on vending machines, providing audio feedback to guide the user's hand.
* **Smart Long Cane:** We instrumented a standard white cane with inertial sensors (accelerometers/gyroscopes). By applying **sensor fusion algorithms**, we could analyze the user's sweeping technique and detect obstacles without heavy cameras.
