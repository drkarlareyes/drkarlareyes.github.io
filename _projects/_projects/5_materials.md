### Electrochemical Characterization & Surface Engineering

* **Harmonic Structure Design:**
    * **Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS):** Fabricated **Ti6Al4V** alloys with a "Harmonic Structure" (a heterostructure coupling coarse and fine grains).
    * **Performance:** Demonstrated that this specific microstructural manipulation improves mechanical strength without compromising **electrochemical stability** in simulated body fluids (SBF).

* **Binary Alloy Stability:**
    * **Potentiodynamic Polarization:** Characterized the passivation kinetics of **Binary Ti-Nb** alloys.
    * **Passive Film Analysis:** Investigated the formation of stable oxide layers ($\text{TiO}_2$, $\text{Nb}_2\text{O}_5$) that prevent ion release and mitigate cytotoxicity.

* **Nanotubular Surface Modification:**
    * **Anodic Oxidation:** Engineered self-organized **$\text{TiO}_2$ nanotube arrays** on titanium surfaces via controlled anodization.
    * **Bioactivity:** Verified the capacity of these nanostructures to induce hydroxyapatite precipitation, significantly accelerating osseointegration.

* **Tantalum Oxide Growth:**
    * **Electrolytic Growth:** Controlled the growth of compact **Tantalum Oxide** films in varying electrolytes to optimize dielectric properties and corrosion resistance for orthopedic applications.
