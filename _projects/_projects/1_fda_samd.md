**Note:** This portfolio entry aggregates my work as a Lead AI Developer and Technical Consultant for several private US and international healthcare companies. Due to strict Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), specific codebases, proprietary algorithms, and client names are confidential.

### Project Scope: Scalable Clinical Decision Support
[cite_start]Acting as a self-employed **Lead AI Developer**, I provide specialized consulting to healthcare technology companies[cite: 18]. My role is to accompany these organizations through the complex process of building **Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS)**, handling everything from the initial data strategy to the final deployment of algorithms.

[cite_start]I function not just as an advisor, but as the primary technical executioner—writing the code, building the models, and ensuring the data science aligns with business goals[cite: 19].

### Technical Engineering & MLOps
[cite_start]My consulting work focuses on the "hands-on" development of production-grade software[cite: 20]:

* **Continuous Learning Pipelines (CI/CD/CT):** I engineer automated **MLOps pipelines** that ingest incoming patient data, trigger retraining cycles, and perform automated validation against safety thresholds. This ensures client models adapt to new data distributions without service interruption.
* **Data Engineering & ETL:** I write the code to build robust Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) architectures. [cite_start]This involves harmonizing multi-modal data from disparate sources (EHRs, lab results, wearable sensors) to ensure data quality for high-stakes clinical inference[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]**Regulatory Alignment (FDA/SaMD):** I accompany clients in the technical documentation process, ensuring that the AI architecture supports **Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)** protocols (ISO 13485 / IEC 62304) required for FDA submission[cite: 20].

### Data Science Consulting & Strategy
As an external partner, I bridge the gap between raw data and deployed medical products:
* **Code Implementation:** I deliver clean, reproducible Python codebases for predictive modeling and signal processing.
* **Algorithmic Strategy:** I advise companies on the correct choice of algorithms (Deep Learning vs. Classical ML) based on their specific data constraints and interpretability requirements.
* **Technical Accompaniment:** I guide internal teams and stakeholders through the AI lifecycle, ensuring that technical debt is minimized and that the solutions are scalable for future growth.
