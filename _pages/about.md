[cite_start]I am a Researcher at the **VSB Technical University of Ostrava** (Czech Republic) collaborating with the eHealth Lab[cite: 9, 11]. [cite_start]I am a Biomedical Engineer and Healthcare Data Scientist with experience bridging the gap between clinical medicine, digital health innovation, and artificial intelligence[cite: 3, 5].

[cite_start]I hold a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from **Universidad Politécnica de Madrid**[cite: 75]. [cite_start]My research focuses on **Deep Learning**, **Physiological Signal Processing** (Radar, ECG, Inertial, and Wearable sensors), and **Clinical Decision Support Systems**[cite: 3, 4]. [cite_start]I specialize in developing regulatory-compliant AI (Software as a Medical Device - SaMD) and designing continuous learning pipelines for automated model retraining[cite: 4, 19].

[cite_start]Previously, I served as a Research Scholar at **UC Santa Cruz** (Computer Vision Lab in Santa Cruz California) [cite: 29, 30] [cite_start]and **Karlsruhe Institute of Technology** (Computer Vision and Accesibility Lab in Germany) [cite: 34][cite_start], where I worked on assistive technologies for the visually impaired and biomechanical analysis[cite: 31, 36].

**Current Research Interests:**
* [cite_start]**Non-contact Vital Sign Monitoring:** Signal processing techniques to estimate vital signs of freely moving people using radar technology[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]**AI for Medical Imaging:** Automated grading of spinal abnormalities and neuroradiology image processing using Deep Transfer Learning[cite: 27, 88].
* [cite_start]**Assistive Technology:** Deep learning methods to extract motion characteristics from human activity for rehabilitation and ankle-foot orthotics[cite: 13, 14].

[cite_start]I have mentored over 30 undergraduate and master students on research projects regarding assistive technology, biomedical engineering, and computer science [cite: 15, 26].
